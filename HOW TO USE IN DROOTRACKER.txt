The big idea here is to run tasty-dirk-api from inside drootracker's src folder to
avoid having to set up webpack to include files outside of src (which I could not get to work).

Place services > tasty-dirk-api in the same folder in drootracker.
npm install inside tasty-dirk-api

Place (or copy the relevant content) of craco.config.js into the same file in drootracker.

The key lines to edit for rate limiting are in
services > tasty-dirk-api > lib > market-data-streamer.ts line 350: "acceptAggregationPeriod": 10,

This "acceptAggregationPeriod" does nothing right now (2/1/2024) the dxfeed server defaults/overrides it to 0.5 seconds.
